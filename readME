Hello!

This is a readME file for my midterm project.

Things to Know (in order):

Controls (line 12)
Lore
Puzzle Instructions


Controls:
A & D: Move cannon left and right
Spacebar: Fire cannon
S: Update score
Esc: Return to level select

Reason for Update Score:
I wanted the user to be able to decide when all the pins had finished falling down. If you want to pray that the pins will fall down on their own after the first shot, go
for it. 

Lore:
Evil pins are threatening to escape from the bowling dimension! It is your job to take them out. Thankfully, you have been equipped with your trusty bowling cannon. Due
to the ancient rules of bowling, launching bowling balls at the pins is the only thing effective against them. However, you only get two shots per level to take out the
pins (that's how bowling works). Green walls can stop the bowling balls, but we've manage to sneak some bouncy orange walls behind enemy lines to help get around those. 
Good luck, the universe is counting on you!
      
The pins do not disappear after they fall down because the pins believe in helping their comrades postmortem.

Puzzle Instructions:
Level 1 is very easy, it is made to resemble a normal bowling setup and let the user get used to the controls. Just hit the spacebar and then update score once the pins
are down.

Level 2 is a bit harder. You need to aim the cannon at the orange wall and shoot at it. If your angle is correct, it will bounce off the wall and into the pins.
Then, once again, update score once the pins are down.
